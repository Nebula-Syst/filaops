"""
Multi-user seat caps for FilaOps Core.

The ``multi_user`` capability is a PRO feature: unlicensed (community) installs
get a single staff seat, while licensed installs (professional / enterprise) get
unlimited staff seats.

A *seat* is a STAFF/team user account — ``account_type`` in ``admin`` or
``operator``. Customer / portal accounts (``account_type == "customer"``) are NOT
team members and never consume or count against a seat.

Tier is read directly from ``app.core.plugin_registry`` (set by the filaops-pro
plugin at startup). This module is deliberately independent of
``app.core.features.LICENSING_ENABLED`` — that legacy master switch is dormant
(everything free) and owned by a separate change; seat enforcement must work
regardless of its value so the leak is actually closed.

GRANDFATHERING: the cap only blocks *adding* or *activating* a NEW staff seat
beyond the cap. It never deactivates or locks out existing users. An install that
is already over the cap (e.g. a pre-existing multi-user community deployment)
keeps every current user working; it simply cannot add or reactivate another
staff member until it upgrades. There is no startup- or login-time enforcement.

    Reads the current tier from ``plugin_registry``. On a capped tier
    (community), blocks the action when the resulting active-staff count would
    exceed the cap. On an uncapped tier (professional/enterprise) this is a
    no-op.

    GRANDFATHER: this only guards the *incremental* seat. It never touches or
    deactivates existing users; installs already over the cap keep working and
    are simply prevented from adding more.

    CONCURRENCY (TOCTOU): the count-then-insert/activate performed by the caller
    is check-then-act. Two concurrent create/activate requests could each read
    a below-cap count and both proceed, overshooting the cap. To close that gap
    we take a transaction-scoped Postgres advisory lock at the top of the check.
    ``enforce_seat_cap`` runs inside the request's DB session/transaction and the
    caller commits the insert/activation on that SAME session with no
    intermediate commit, so the xact lock is held until that commit. A second
    concurrent request therefore blocks here until the first commits, then its
    count reflects the newly-added seat and it correctly 403s. The lock
    auto-releases at commit/rollback — no explicit unlock needed.

    Args:
        db: Database session.
        exclude_user_id: When activating/reactivating an existing user, pass its
            id so it is not double-counted against the cap.
